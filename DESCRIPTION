Description: This package contains S4 classes and methods for the
    development of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). New EDAs can 
    be created specifying functions implementing its parts: seeding, selection, 
    learning, sampling, repairing, replacement, local optimization, termination 
    and reporting methods. The package also contains implementations of EDAs 
    and functions for the analysis of the results of EDAs. The package was 
    inspired by the MATEDA toolbox for MATLAB.
