Description: This package contains implementations of various classes of Estimation
    of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on copula theory: Copula EDAs and Vine
    EDAs. In this package, EDAs are implemented using S4 classes with generic
    functions for its main parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling, 
    replacement, local optimization, termination, and reporting. This modular 
    design was inspired by the Mateda-2.0 toolbox for MATLAB. The package also 
    includes the implementation of a group of well-known continuous optimization 
    test problems and utility functions to study the behavior of EDAs.
