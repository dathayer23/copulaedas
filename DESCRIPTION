Description: This package contains S4 classes and methods for the
	development of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs).
	EDAs can be implemented by defining methods for generic functions
	that specify its main parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling,
	replacement, local optimization, termination and reporting. It also
	contains implementations of continuous EDAs based on copula theory,
	a group of well-known continuous optimization test problems and
	utility functions to analyze the results of EDAs. The modular design
	of the package was inspired by the MATEDA toolbox for MATLAB.
