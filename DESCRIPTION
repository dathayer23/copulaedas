Description: This package contains S4 classes and methods for the
    development of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). New EDAs can 
    be created specifying methods for generic functions implementing its main 
    parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling, repairing, replacement, local 
    optimization, termination and reporting methods. It also contains complete 
    implementations of EDAs and functions to analyze the results of EDAs. 
    The package was inspired by the MATEDA toolbox for MATLAB.
